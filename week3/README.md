# Week 2: Multiple Regression

Run `ipython notebook` in this directory to get started.

The goal of this week is to get a better understanding of how libraries are used in machine learning, and to use multiple regression to create a model that performs better at making predictions.

### Summary
- Multiple Regression: taking [x1, x2, ..., xn] and predicting y (a function f(x) = w1x1^i1 + w2x2^i2 + ... + wnxn^i2 + E, its a polynomial so better at fitting complex data sets)

- SKLearn takes what we did last week and turns it into one line of code, but its important to have some idea of what's going on underneath.
