# Week 1: Linear Regression

To run the notebook, in a terminal run `ipython notebook` from this directory and open `housing_regression.ipynb`.

The goal of this week is to explore a very basic machine learning technique, and to see what machine learning actually looks like in practice.

### Summary

- Linear Regression: taking x and predicting y (a function f(x) = wx^n + E is produced, now for any value of x you can predict a y, but its a monomial, not good at fitting complex data sets)

- Multiple Regression: taking [x1, x2, ..., xn] and predicting y (a function f(x) = w1x1^i1 + w2x2^i2 + ... + wnxn^i2 + E, its a polynomial so better at fitting complex data sets)


[Here's](http://www.biddle.com/documents/bcg_comp_chapter4.pdf) a pretty good (long) chapter introducing Regression if you want more.
